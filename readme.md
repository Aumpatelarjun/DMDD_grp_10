# Airlines Reservation System

## Background

The aviation industry has witnessed a substantial increase in global air travel, necessitating the need for an efficient and modernized Airlines Reservation System. Traditional methods are no longer adequate to meet the demands of today's tech-savvy and fast-paced travelers. An Airline Management System is designed to oversee all aspects of airline operations. From scheduling flights to managing air ticket reservations, handling flight cancellations, providing customer support, and efficiently managing staff, the system plays a crucial role in streamlining operations. Our project aims to address this need by developing a comprehensive database architecture for an Airlines Management System.

## Purpose
